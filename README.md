## Project Overview
- Comparison of two distinct methodologies for heart disease classification using a dataset sourced from Kaggle: Traditional analytics using [Python (Scikit-learn)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and Big Data analytics using [Python (PySpark)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google/).
- Detailed examination of the step-by-step implementation of both techniques, beginning with data importation to model evaluation.
- Assessment of the results from both methodologies, comparing their performance metrics, efficiency, and overall effectiveness in achieving the desired classification goals.



## Motivation
- In the healthcare sector, early detection and prevention of diseases like heart disease can lead to decreased morbidity and potential mortality. Modern data analytics techniques, whether conventional or Big Data-centric, offer the promise of improved diagnosis through efficient data handling and insightful model predictions.
	- By comparing traditional and Big Data techniques, the study seeks to determine the most efficient and accurate method to aid healthcare practitioners in decision-making and risk identification.



### Aim & Objectives
- **Aim:** 
	- To compare and evaluate the effectiveness of conventional analytics (Scikit-learn) and Big Data analytics (PySpark) in predicting heart disease using a Kaggle dataset.
- **Objectives:** 
  	- To design and implement a classification model using both methodologies that can predict which patients are likely to develop heart disease in the future based on relevant data variables.
	- To evaluate the performance of the two methodologies in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to determine which method provides superior results in the context of heart disease prediction.
